## 1. Introduction to SAST and Snyk {#introduction}

### What is SAST?

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a method of computer program debugging that analyzes source code to find security vulnerabilities before the software is deployed. Unlike Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), SAST examines code without executing it.

### What is Snyk?

Snyk is a developer-first security platform that helps you find and fix vulnerabilities in your code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code. It provides:

- **Vulnerability scanning** for open source dependencies
- **License compliance** checking
- **Container security** scanning
- **Infrastructure as Code** security
- **Code security** (SAST) analysis

### Why Use Snyk with GitHub Actions?

- **Automated Security**: Runs security checks on every commit/PR
- **Early Detection**: Finds vulnerabilities before they reach production
- **Developer-Friendly**: Integrates seamlessly into existing workflows
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitors for new vulnerabilities in existing dependencies

## 2. Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before starting this practical, ensure you have:

- [ ] A GitHub account with repository access
- [ ] Basic understanding of Git and GitHub
- [ ] Familiarity with Java and Maven
- [ ] Understanding of CI/CD concepts
- [ ] Access to the `cicd-demo` repository

### Getting Started: Clone the Repository

Before proceeding with this practical, you need to clone the `cicd-demo` repository to your local machine.

#### Option 1: Clone the Original Repository (Read-only)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/douglasswmcst/cicd-demo.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd cicd-demo

# Verify the project structure
ls -la
```

#### Option 2: Fork and Clone (Recommended for Practice)

For hands-on practice where you'll be making changes and testing workflows:

1. **Fork the Repository**:

   - Go to https://github.com/douglasswmcst/cicd-demo
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
   - Select your GitHub account as the destination

2. **Clone Your Fork**:

   ```bash
   # Replace 'your-username' with your actual GitHub username
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cicd-demo.git

   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd cicd-demo

   # Add the original repository as upstream (for future updates)
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/douglasswmcst/cicd-demo.git

   # Verify remotes
   git remote -v
   ```

3. **Verify Your Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Check Java version (should be 17 or higher)
   java -version

   # Check Maven installation
   mvn -version

   # Test the project builds successfully
   mvn clean compile

   # Run the tests to ensure everything works
   mvn test
   ```

#### Project Setup Verification

Once cloned, verify your setup by running:

```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
pwd
# Output should end with: /cicd-demo

# Check project structure
tree -L 3
# Or if tree is not available:
find . -type f -name "*.java" -o -name "*.xml" -o -name "*.yml" | head -10

# Start the application locally (optional)
mvn spring-boot:run
# Application should start on http://localhost:8080
# Test with: curl http://localhost:8080/
```

#### Important Notes

- **For Workshop Participants**: Your instructor may provide a specific fork or branch to use
- **Repository Access**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create secrets and run GitHub Actions
- **Network Requirements**: Make sure you can access GitHub Actions and external package repositories

## 7. Advanced Snyk Configuration {#advanced-configuration}

### Step 7.1: Creating a Snyk Configuration File

Create a `.snyk` file in your repository root for custom configurations:

```yaml
# .snyk file
version: v1.0.0

# Ignore specific vulnerabilities
ignore:
  "SNYK-JAVA-ORGAPACHECOMMONS-1234567":
    - "*":
        reason: "False positive - not exploitable in our context"
        expires: "2024-12-31T23:59:59.999Z"

# Patch configuration
patches: {}

# Language settings
language-settings:
  java:
    # Java-specific settings
```

### Step 7.2: Multiple Scan Types

```yaml
security:
  needs: test
  name: Comprehensive Security Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  strategy:
    matrix:
      scan-type: [dependencies, code, container]

  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: "17"
        distribution: "temurin"

    - name: Dependency Scan
      if: matrix.scan-type == 'dependencies'
      uses: snyk/actions/maven@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      with:
        args: --severity-threshold=medium

    - name: Code Scan
      if: matrix.scan-type == 'code'
      uses: snyk/actions/maven@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      with:
        command: code test

    - name: Container Scan
      if: matrix.scan-type == 'container'
      uses: snyk/actions/docker@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      with:
        image: "your-app:latest"
```

### Step 7.3: Conditional Scanning

```yaml
# Only run Snyk on specific conditions
- name: Run Snyk Security Scan
  uses: snyk/actions/maven@master
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
  env:
    SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

       # Test job
     security:
       # Run in parallel with tests for faster feedback
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   ```

2. **Caching Dependencies**:

   ```yaml
   - name: Cache Maven dependencies
     uses: actions/cache@v3
     with:
       path: ~/.m2
       key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
   ```

3. **Conditional Scans**:

   ```yaml
   # Skip scans on documentation-only changes
   - name: Check for code changes
     uses: dorny/paths-filter@v2
     id: changes
     with:
       filters: |
         code:
           - 'src/**'
           - 'pom.xml'

   - name: Run Snyk scan
     if: steps.changes.outputs.code == 'true'
     # ... scan configuration
   ```

   ![Snyk Vulnerabilities](https://img.shields.io/snyk/vulnerabilities/github/yourusername/cicd-demo)
   ```

3. **Configure notification workflow**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Notify on critical vulnerabilities
     if: failure()
     uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
     with:
       status: failure
       text: "Critical security vulnerabilities detected in ${{ github.repository }}"
     env:
       SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
   ```
